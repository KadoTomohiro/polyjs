          <h3>Mazes from OFF files</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/matthewarcus/polyjs/blob/gh-pages/js/maze.js">
              maze.js
            </a>
          <p>
            Given a surface, defined as collection of cells divided
            by walls, we can generated a simple maze by finding a
            spanning tree of the graph whose nodes are the cells and
            whose edges are the walls. Here we use Kruskal's algorithm
            to build up the spanning tree: pick walls randomly to
            include or exclude from the tree; include if the cells on
            either side are already connected, otherwise exclude
            (so as to connect the cells on either side in the
            resulting tree). Repeat until all walls have been
            considered.
          <p>
            We can describe a 3-dimensional surface by a set of points
            and a set of faces, with each face having a list of
            points as its boundary. A wall is then just a pair of
            points that are adjacent in one or two cell boundaries and
            we can then apply our maze generating algorithm as above.
          <p>
            Having determined the set of walls in the maze, we can
            then use the coordinates of the points to
            construct a 3-dimensional model. All we need is a base
            model to start with, and this is conveniently given by an
            OFF file as generated by a tool such as
            <a href="http://antiprism.com/">Antiprism</a>, used here
            to generate models for a (dual) geodesic sphere, a torus
            and a MÃ¶bius strip.

          <h3>A real 3D maze</h3>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/matthewarcus/polyjs/blob/gh-pages/js/maze.js">
              maze3.js
            </a>
          <p>
          Alternatively, we can construct a true 3d maze. Here we
          generate the underlying topology directly with some Javascript:
          <p><a><canvas id="canvas4" height="640" width="800"></canvas></a></p>
          <script>
            function run(canvas,options) {
            var context = new PolyContext(options);
            context.runOnCanvas(canvas,canvas.width,canvas.height);
            canvas.parentElement.href = "poly.html?" + options;
            }
            run(canvas1, "off=off/geo_3_2_d.off&edgewidth=0.01&allvertices&vertexwidth=0.015&texture=images/202.jpg&xnormal=images/202_norm.jpg&colorstyle=0&function=mazify&rotate");
            run(canvas2, "off=off/mobius.off&function=mazify&allvertices&vertexwidth=0.03&nofaces&rotate");
            run(canvas3, "off=off/torus.off&colorstyle=1&function=mazify&allvertices&edgewidth=0.02&vertexwidth=0.03&texture=images/221.jpg&normal=images/221_norm.jpg&z=8&rotate");
            run(canvas4, "function=maze3&alledges&allvertices&normal=images/218_norm.jpg&texture=images/218.jpg&rotate&z=5");
          </script>
        </div>
        <p> This is all based on a Three.js based framework I've been
        playing around with for drawing polyhedra and other geometric
        objects:
